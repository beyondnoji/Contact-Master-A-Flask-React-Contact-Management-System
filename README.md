# I recently completed a full-stack project utilizing Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. 
# Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development.

# This involved understanding the intricacies of defining routes and endpoints to ensure smooth data flow between different parts of the application.
